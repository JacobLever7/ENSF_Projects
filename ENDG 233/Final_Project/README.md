This is a copy of my final project in ENDG 233 which was worked on with a partner.
This python file uses Pandas to read data from three seperate files contained in "data_folder" and performs different calculations from the data.
Using Matplotlib there is an option after data is calculated to plot the data onto a simple chart.
