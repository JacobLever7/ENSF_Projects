# ENSF_300_Calculator
This is a copy of my first assignment in ENSF 300 with my group.
We were tasked to complete a simple calculator similar to one we made in ENDG 233 and allowed to repurpose old code.
The main challenge we experienced was using Git and Github to work collaboratively as we were all new to version control.

My main task was to design the logic for the order of operations of the calculator (BEDMAS) 
filename: "evaluate_funct.py"

I mainly repurposed the old code from my past assignment in ENDG 233 but had to fix some errors in the logic as well as integrating the new functions that my partners designed. These functions included the basic operation functions(+ - * /), print function, validation function(validate user input), main function(runs the functions in the correct order).

To run the code run: "calculator.py"
