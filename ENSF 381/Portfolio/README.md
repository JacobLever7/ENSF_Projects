This is a copy of a portfolio assignment created using HTML and vanilla CSS. The purpose of this assignment was to develop our skills with HTML and CSS and allow us to become more confortable with basic front end development.

This Assignment was apart of ENSF 381 which was taken during the second semester of my second year at the Universtity of Calgary and was our 4th assignment.
