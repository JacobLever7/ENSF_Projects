This is a copy of a partnered assignment which was to replicate the Notion note taking app. We used React with AWS-functions; Lambda, Terraform and DynamoDB for the backend storage of the notes. We also used Google login is order to authenticate unique users and save to the DynamoDB table accordingly.

This Assignment was apart of ENSF 381 which was taken during the second semester of my second year at the Universtity of Calgary and was our 6th assignment.
